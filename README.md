## Project Name: Course Ratings

One of the most stressful times during the school year for a student is registration for the next quarter.  Picking the best classes and more importantly the teacher for the class could change a student’s experience for the course. At the end of each quarter, students fill out an evaluation form for professors, rating the professor on different questions posed for example how hard the professor graded.  Currently, UW provides a Course Evaluation page for students to visit in order to see how previous students have rated a particular professor. The current course catalog page simply has a list of classes/professors, each one linked to a page containing a chart with percentages of effectiveness of professors for each category. All of those who have visited this website to decide which professors to take classes from has always complained about how difficult it is to compare ratings for different professor and how uninviting the website is.

The dataset contains professor ratings for different courses he or she has taught for the past two years. Each instructor/course was rated on a scale from 0 to 5 along 26 dimensions including:
* The course as a whole
* The course content
* The instructor’s effectiveness
* The amount learned
* The grading technique

The course catalog only contains information for the past 2-3 quarters, but this project has been on our to-do list for over a year, therefore we have data spanning 8 quarters. The dataset also  included information about the course for example quarter taught and the number of students who took the evaluation.

## Running Instructions

Put your running instructions here. (Tell us how to run your visualization.)

If your visualization is web-based,  it would be great if your submission can be opened online. [Github Pages](http://pages.github.com/) is a good and easy way to put your visualization online so you can put your link here.  For example:

Access our visualization at http://cse512-15s.github.io/a3-jheer-domoritz-jasnyder/ or download this repository and run `python -m SimpleHTTPServer 9000` and access this from http://localhost:9000/.

If you put your work online, please also write a [one-line description and add a link to your final work](http://note.io/1n3u46s) so people can access it directly from the CSE512-15S page.

## Story Board

Put either your storyboard content or a [link to your storyboard pdf file](storyboard.pdf?raw=true) here. Just like A2, you can use any software to create a *reasonable* pdf storyboard.


### Changes between Storyboard and the Final Implementation

A paragraph explaining changes between the storyboard and the final implementation.


## Development Process

Include:
- Breakdown of how the work was split among the group members.
- A commentary on the development process, including answers to the following questions:
  - Roughly how much time did you spend developing your application?
  - What aspects took the most time?
